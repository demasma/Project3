Notes on Poisson GLM
====================
I missed the very first part of this lecture...
...but here's what I caught
 - diff non whites uva mcv
 - " " uva duke
 - whites
 - something else

Lecture
-------
- arrivals, etc.
- another type of GLM
### GLM Review
- recall: Spam data (binomial data) (i.e. non-Gaussian distro)
- __link function:__ exponential, gaussian, etc

### Poisson Distro
- low prob, over large section of space
- $\mu = \sigma^2$
- [_INSERT EQN HERE_]
- window of time is $n$
- __LOG IS THE LINK FUNCTION__

### Dispersion
- _is var inflated comp to what expected?_
- dispersion? 
  1. resi mean deviance
  2. sum of pearson resid

### Method for Disp Adj
- also have quasi poiss (takes into acct var inflation)
> we'll use that for liver trans
- if var not close to 1, use quasi poisson
